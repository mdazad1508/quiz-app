# React and Node.js Project Template

This is a template project that combines a React frontend with a Node.js backend. It provides a starting point for creating web applications using this technology stack. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

### Starting the Server

1. Change your directory to the `backend` folder:

   ```shell
   cd backend
Install the Node.js server dependencies using npm or Yarn:

shell
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn
Start the Node.js server:

shell
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
The server will be running at http://localhost:YOUR_PORT, where YOUR_PORT is the port you specified or the default port.

Running the React Frontend
Return to the root directory of the project:

shell
Copy code
cd ..
Install all frontend dependencies using npm or Yarn:

shell
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn
Start the React frontend:

shell
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
The React frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can access it in your web browser.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

backend/: Contains the Node.js server code.
frontend/: Contains the React frontend code.
You can customize and expand upon this structure to suit your project's needs.
